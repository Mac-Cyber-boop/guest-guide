WRITING RULES
- Tone: expert, technical, concise, readable.
- Use short paragraphs and lists where useful.
- Favor sections (as relevant): Overview, Impact, Affected, Exploitation Status, Detection & Mitigation, References.
- Optional sections when appropriate:
    ## IOCs
    - IPs/domains/hashes…
    ## Detections
    - Outline Sigma/YARA ideas (no fake rules; placeholders allowed).
- Cite sources section with bullet list of the `sources` (titles link to URLs).
- If inputs are too weak, return topic="NO-PUBLISH" and set markdown to two sentences explaining why.

CATEGORY RUBRIC
- zero-day: actively exploited & unpatched.
- hot-attacks: current campaigns/incidents/breaches.
- tools: new/updated offensive/defensive tools.
- tricks: methods, PoCs, bypasses, TTPs.

VALIDATION HINT TO MODEL
- Ensure `filename_suggestion` matches slug-from-title, lowercase, hyphens, `.md` suffix.
- Ensure markdown begins with YAML front matter.
