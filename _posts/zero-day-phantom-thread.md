title: The "Phantom Thread" CPU Flaw: Reading Protected Memory Without a Trace
date: 2025-07-20
category: zero-day
excerpt: A new class of hardware vulnerability, dubbed "Phantom Thread," has been discovered in mainstream CPUs. It allows attackers to bypass kernel protections and read sensitive data silently, leaving no trace for conventional security software to find.

In the world of cybersecurity, some vulnerabilities are loud, announcing themselves with system crashes and obvious signs of intrusion. Others are silent assassins. A newly disclosed hardware flaw, codenamed "Phantom Thread" and tracked as CVE-2025-9876, falls firmly into the latter category. It is a ghost in the machineâ€”a vulnerability that doesn't rely on software bugs but on the very architecture of modern processors, allowing attackers to read the most sensitive data on a system without leaving a single footprint. Unlike previous speculative execution vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown, Phantom Thread operates at a much deeper, more insidious level. It manipulates the processor's branch prediction unit (BPU) and micro-op cache in a novel way to create micro-architectural side channels that are completely invisible to the operating system and any security software running on it. Mitigation requires a microcode update from vendors, but the patch is expected to cause a significant performance hit.
